Twitter NLP Tools
====================
Authors: Alan Ritter, Sam Clark

contact: aritter@cs.washington.edu

Example Usage:
--------------

	export TWITTER_NLP=./
	cat test.1k.txt | python python/ner/extractEntities2.py

note: this takes a minute or so to read in models from files


To include classification, simply add the --classify switch:

	cat test.1k.txt | python python/ner/extractEntities2.py --classify


For higher quality, but slower results, optionally include features based on POS and chunk tags
(chunk tags require POS)

	cat test.1k.txt | python python/ner/extractEntities2.py --classify --pos
	cat test.1k.txt | python python/ner/extractEntities2.py --classify --pos --chunk

Also has the ability to include event tags (requires POS):

	cat test.1k.txt | python python/ner/extractEntities2.py --classify --pos --event

Output:
-------------
The output contains the tokenized and tagged words separated by spaces with tags separated
by forward slash '/'
Example output:

	The/B-movie/DT/B-NP/O Town/I-movie/NNP/I-NP/O might/O/MD/B-VP/O be/O/VB/I-VP/O one/O/CD/B-NP/O of/O/IN/B-PP/O the/O/DT/B-NP/O best/O/JJS/I-NP/O movies/O/NNS/I-NP/O I/O/PRP/B-NP/O have/O/VBP/B-VP/O seen/O/VBN/I-VP/O all/O/DT/B-NP/O year/O/NN/I-NP/O ./O/./O/O So/O/RB/O/O ,/O/,/O/O so/O/RB/B-ADJP/O good/O/JJ/I-ADJP/O ./O/./O/O And/O/CC/O/O don't/O/NN/B-NP/O worry/O/NN/I-NP/O Ben/B-person/NNP/I-NP/O ,/O/,/O/O we/O/PRP/B-NP/O already/O/RB/B-ADVP/O forgave/O/VBP/B-VP/B-EVENT you/O/PRP/B-NP/O for/O/IN/B-PP/O Gigli/B-movie/NNP/B-NP/O ./O/./O/O Really/O/RB/B-INTJ/O ./O/./I-INTJ/O

Looking at just one word:

	The/B-movie/DT/B-NP/O

The fields are as follows:

<table>
<tr>
  <td>Word:</td>
  <td>The</td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Entity:</td>
  <td>B-movie</td>
  <td>Begins a named entity of type "movie"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Chunk:</td>
  <td>B-NP</td>
  <td>Begins a noun phrase</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Event:</td>
  <td>O</td>
  <td>Not part of an event phrase</td>
</tr>
</table>

The BIO encoding is used for encoding phrases (Named Entities, event phrases, and chunks), for example:

    The/B-movie Town/I-movie might/O ...

Indicates that the word "The" begins a named entity of type movie, "Town" continues that entity, and "might" is outside of an entity mention.  For more details see: http://nltk.org/book/ch07.html
