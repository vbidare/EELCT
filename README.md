## Setup
- Add `TweeboParser` to `./lib` and conpile it. (Can be downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/tweeboparser/)

- Install the following jar files
	i. gson: http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson/2.3.1
	ii. org.json: https://code.google.com/p/org-json-java/downloads/list
	iii. Apache tika: https://tika.apache.org/download.html
	
- After that everything should work, hopefully!
